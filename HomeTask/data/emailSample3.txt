HiðŸ‘‹

 

After reviewing your application to participate in the OKP4 Incentivized Testnet, you were unfortunately not selected.

 

On behalf of the entire OKP4 team, we would like to thank you for your interest in our project and the application quality you sent us. Unfortunately, as you know, only 150 places were available, and we received over 6,700 applications!

 

To do this, we had to establish selection criteria to bring out the best applications. Here are the criteria that enabled us to sort through the 6,700 applications:

 

Quality and relevance of the application (team, hardware, etc.)
Experience and skills as a validator (nodes in other projects, etc.)
Your reputation in the ecosystem
Your community
 

The Nemeton Program will now start with its phase 1, the Sidh, from December 1st, 2022!

 

The 150 druids will participate in the OKP4 Incentivized Testnet, and you are invited to contribute to the final phase of the Nemeton Program. 

 

So, we invite you to stay tuned to the OKP4 project news as all participants will be able to participate in Phase 5 and thus receive rewards for releasing the mainnet!

 

Thanks !
